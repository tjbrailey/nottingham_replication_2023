# Introduction

This memo begins by replicating the main exhibits in @Frederiksen2022a (as well as some of the exhibits in their supplementary materials section^[See [@Frederiksen2022b; @Frederiksen2022c]]) using the R programming language. 

# Replication

## Replication of Main Exhibits

The main paper only contains one exhibit, Figure 1, replicated below. The figure replicates exactly, though it should be noted that the the upper panels of Figure 1 are calculated without reference to a base category, while the lower panels are the marginal means compared to the third category of the independent variable (`cancom`).

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Replication of Figure 1"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(here::here("exhibits", "figures"), "/figure1_replication.pdf"))
```

## Replication of Appendix A

Both tables in Appendix A replicate exactly in terms of point estimates, statistical significance, and number of observations.

\input{../exhibits/tables/table_a1_replication.tex}

\input{../exhibits/tables/table_a2_replication.tex}

# Extension

In this section, I extend the analysis presented in @Frederiksen2022a.
